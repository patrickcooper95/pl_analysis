**English Premier League - Quickest to First**

Given Liverpool's dominance this Premier League season (2019-2020) and that it had already accumulated enough points for it to be
mathematically impossible to finish last in the league (20th) by December, I began to wonder how this compares to previous seasons.

Using the english_premier_league.zip and the results.csv files (sources below), we can generate match-by-match tables in Python for each season 
from 2009 to 2018 to determine the average date or matches played a team reaches this milestone, the quickest it has been done within our sampled years, 
and look a little more into what teams were involved.

The singular Python file, pl_finish.py, provides all the code we need. Below are the results:

**Some quick facts about reaching this milestone each season:**

**On average:**

Matches Played - 26

Points Needed - 60

Date Achieved - February 11th


**Quickest to do it: 2017-2018 Manchester City (January 20th - 24 Matches)**
  - Already topped by this year's Liverpool team

**Slowest to do it: 2010-2011 Manchester United (February 26th - 27 Matches)**
  - In large part, due to a competitive bottom of the table, with West Ham having 25 points at the time United reached this mark.
  
**Fewest Points Needed: 2015-2016 Leicester City, 53**
